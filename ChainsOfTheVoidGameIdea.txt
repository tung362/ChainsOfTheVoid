2Dish geometry space RTS

Set up bases, upgrade and reasearch new weapons and armor
Customize ships
Resources spawns in clusters and randomly in the world

use quads to make shapes
Customize ships and save and prefab (Also save connection points)
Use Sphere Colliders as snap tools
Weapons can be set to attack(Closest unless specified) or projectile defense (Can be also set individually or as a group)
Shields and regular hull armor takes different damage depending on the projectile
Build limits are based on tech point
Ships can benifit from left, right, and forward turn
Camera Limits: -5 - -30

Notes:
Camera: -18
0.01 turret offset
For Thrusters use a diagonal to determine which thurst benifits which turn / for left turn \ for right turn
For Thrusters any thruster facing close to forward direction benifits forward movement
Use Sphere Colliders for Alignment

Modeling notes:
Scale of 1 unit
Pivot:
x:90
y:0
z:0
side calculation:
180 - 128.57(Angle) = 51.43
51.43 * 2(side number)
